# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
##Introduction
This is for the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data course from Johns Hopkins University. The project uses the data set from wearable computing experiments, and more detailed description can be found from the following website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

##The general process of the project
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##The scripts include following files: 
- "Readme.md": the general description of all scripts 
- "CodeBook.md": the description of the data, variables and transformations 
- "run_analysis.R": the code to do the data cleaning work
- "tidydata": the final tidy data generated from the work
